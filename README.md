## Why I Used SvelteKit

Initially the portfolio was created on Nuxt 3 and it is still viewable on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Spimy/spimy.dev_nuxt) but I absolute hated working with [UnJS](https://github.com/unjs) that Nuxt 3 decided to use for its backend. It started becoming messy and some code also kind of difficult to maintain because I just did whatever to made things work. As such, I decided to recode the entire project in SvelteKit.
